# zsh-summit-theme

Yet another zsh theme mainly based on [Robby Russell's *robbyrussell* theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/robbyrussell.zsh-theme) and [Zeit's *zeit* theme](https://github.com/zeit/zeit.zsh-theme), with some inspiration from [Sorin Ionescu's *sorin* theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/sorin.zsh-theme).
