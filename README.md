# zsh-summit-theme

Yet another zsh theme mainly based on [Robby Russell's *robbyrussell* theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/robbyrussell.zsh-theme) and [Zeit's *zeit* theme](https://github.com/zeit/zeit.zsh-theme), with some inspiration from [Sorin Ionescu's *sorin* theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/sorin.zsh-theme).

The `summit_user` theme has been conceived for use by unprivileged users, whereas the `summit_root` one by the `root` user.
